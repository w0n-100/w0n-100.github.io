  <strong>Short Bio</strong><br>
</p>
<p> 
  My name is Hyunwoo Kim, and I have completed my Master's degree at <a href="http://xai.korea.ac.kr/" target="_blank">Korea University's Department of Artificial Intelligence</a> under the guidance of Professor <a href="https://research.com/u/seong-whan-lee" target="_blank">Seonghwan Lee</a>. My academic journey has been deeply rooted in the field of computer vision, focusing on 3D Human Pose Estimation and Multi-view Geometry. Currently, my research interests are particularly concentrated on Multi-modal AI, Memory Augmented AI, RAG, 3DGS.
  <br><br>
  During my undergraduate studies, I participated in corporate projects as an intern research student, and I successfully carried out corporate projects during my graduate studies as well. My research achievements include first-author publications in <a href="https://buly.kr/AwdYIP2" target="_blank">ACCV</a> and <a href="https://buly.kr/4QlW0EO" target="_blank">Pattern Recognition</a>, with my work being selected for an oral presentation at ACCV.
  <br><br>
  My goal is to continue advancing the field of AI by developing innovative solutions that bridge the gap between visual and textual data. Ultimately, I aim to contribute to the creation of intelligent systems that understand and interact with the world more naturally and effectively.
